/**
 * Lock state type definitions.
 *
 * A lock provides exclusive access to a workspace. The state tracks:
 * - What operation acquired the lock (dataflow, deployment, etc.)
 * - Who holds the lock (East text-encoded string)
 * - When it was acquired
 * - Optional expiry (for cloud TTL-based locks)
 *
 * Lock file location: workspaces/<name>.lock
 *
 * The holder field is an East text-encoded string, allowing different backends
 * to encode their own holder identification. Common patterns:
 * - Local: `.process (pid=1234, bootId="abc-123", startTime=98765, command="e3 start")`
 * - Cloud: `.lambda (requestId="req-123", functionName="e3-api")`
