# Overview

## Structure

This is an npm workspace monorepo containing the e3 (East Execution Engine) packages.
The directory structure is:

 - packages/e3-types - Shared type definitions for e3
 - packages/e3 - TypeScript SDK for users to create e3 packages
 - packages/e3-core - Core business logic library (like libgit2)
 - packages/e3-cli - CLI tool (like git)
 - packages/e3-api-client - HTTP client for remote e3 repositories
 - packages/e3-api-server - HTTP server exposing e3-core as REST API
 - packages/e3-api-tests - Integration tests for API client/server
 - test/integration - End-to-end CLI tests
 - test/fuzz - Fuzz testing (Virtual Idiot)
 - design - Design documentation (see design/e3-mvp.md for overview)

## Purpose

e3 allows users to create and execute end-to-end business solutions, tying together data integrations, simulation, optimization, machine learning and dashboards into holistic dataflow programs.

A single solution may involve NodeJS for integrations, python for machine learning and Julia for native-speed simulations.
The East language provides a structural type system and standardized serialization formats for communications between different runtimes.
An e3 repository holds and manages datasets and East programs, and automatically orchestrates dataflow tasks so the user does not need to worry about "plumbing".

## Concepts

 - **e3 repository** - a git-inspired directory structure with a SHA256 content-addressed object store
 - **package** - an immutable collection of East IR, tasks, datasets and dataflows
 - **workspace** - a package is deployed to a workspace, where input datasets can be mutated and automated dataflow executed (with consistency guarantees)
 - **runner** - a program that e3 can spawn to execute a task
 - **IR** - East's intermediate representation, representing an East program that has passed through East's front-end compiler
 - **dataset** - like git, workspace data is stored in a "tree" with datasets as the leaves - each dataset has a "path" and a fixed East type
 - **task** - a combination of a runner (an East interpretter or JIT compiler) and inputs datasets to be provided (both East IR and input data to the task)
 - **dataflow** - the DAG of tasks and datasets to be executed in a workspace
 - **execution** - a single run of a task, identified by `(taskHash, inputsHash, executionId)` where executionId is a UUIDv7
 - **dataflow run** - a complete execution of a workspace's dataflow, tracking which task executions were used
 - **per-dataset ref** - each dataset has its own atomic `.ref` file (`workspaces/<ws>/data/<path>.ref`) instead of a single root tree hash, enabling concurrent per-dataset writes
 - **version vector** - a `Map<string, string>` tracking which root input content hashes contributed to each dataset, used to detect stale reads in diamond dependencies
 - **reactive execution** - after each task completes, the orchestrator detects root input changes, invalidates affected tasks, and re-executes until a fixpoint is reached
